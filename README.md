BCG GENAI job simulation 
I have successfully completed the GenAI Job Simulation by Boston Consulting Group (BCG)! ðŸŽ‰

During this program, I worked on:
âœ… Data Extraction & Initial Analysis â€“ Extracting key financial data from 10-K reports
âœ… AI-Powered Financial Chatbot Development â€“ Building an AI chatbot to analyze financial trends and provide insights


This experience has strengthened my skills in AI, NLP, financial analysis, and chatbot development, preparing me to tackle real-world AI challenges in the finance sector!
A big thank you to BCG for this incredible learning opportunity.
